    "   * Voting Process: Employees are requested to input the number of voters participating in the awards. Each voter is presented      with a list of nominees, and they can vote for their preferred candidate by entering the corresponding number.\n",

    "   * Recording Votes: The script records each vote for the selected candidate and prints a confirmation message indicating that      the vote has been recorded.\n",
    "   * Results Display: Once all votes are collected, the system displays the voting results, showing the number of votes each        candidate received in each category.\n",
    "   * Award Winners: Based on the voting results, the HR department can identify the winners for each award category and proceed      with recognizing and rewarding the selected employees during the Annual Employee Recognition Ceremony.\n",
    "   * This script provides a straightforward and transparent way for employees to participate in the recognition process,            fostering a sense of engagement and community within the organization. The HR team can use the collected votes to              acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of outstanding employees in various aspects of their work."
